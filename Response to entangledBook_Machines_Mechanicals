What does it mean by lively-ness of Automata? The way how it looks? The way how it behaves?
Salter explores the long-time of human trying to create "lively" robots.

What gives lively-ness to robots, and what does it mean by lively-ness?
In order to discuss about lively-ness of something that does not have "life",
we have to focus on the HUMAN point of view, the anthromorphic way.

How do we know something is alive or not? We learn the behaviors, outlooks, and so many information 
to understand what are living creatures around us. In order to provide lively-ness to robots,
we need a deep understanding of the vast information that defines "alive" in our point of view.

Since, everyone has different way of thinking, so does the "lively-ness" of robots.
Some might think an automata is lively, some might not.

Maybe the way to give lively-ness means to convince as many audience as possible that the
robot is alive.
